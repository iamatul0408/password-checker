                               ðŸ”· Title: Password Strength Checker â€“ Cybersecurity Project Report



ðŸŸ© 1. Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, weak passwords are one of the most common vulnerabilities. The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based password strength checker that analyzes a userâ€™s password and classifies it as Weak, Medium, or Strong based on multiple security criteria.

ðŸŸ© 2. Objective

To build a simple Python program that:

Accepts a password from the user.

Checks it against basic strength criteria.

Provides feedback to the user regarding its security level.

ðŸŸ© 3. Tools & Technologies

Tool  -	Purpose
Python - Programming language used
Replit - Online IDE for development & testing
GitHub - To host the code and project files

ðŸŸ© 4. Features

The password is checked against the following rules:

Minimum 8 characters

At least 1 lowercase letter

At least 1 uppercase letter

At least 1 digit

At least 1 special character (@, #, $, etc.)

Each criterion adds to the strength of the password.

ðŸŸ© 5. Working of the Code

User inputs the password.

The program uses Regular Expressions (regex) to validate each rule.

Based on how many criteria are met, the program assigns a strength level:

Strong â€“ All 5 rules passed

Medium â€“ 3 or 4 rules passed

Weak â€“ Less than 3 rules passed

It then shows a checklist result.

ðŸŸ© 6. Sample Output

yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter your password: Hello@123

Password Strength: Strong

Criteria Check:
 - Length >= 8 characters: âœ”
 - At least one lowercase letter: âœ”
 - At least one uppercase letter: âœ”
 - At least one digit: âœ”
 - At least one special character: âœ”

ðŸŸ© 7. Advantages

Simple and user-friendly

Helps users understand password security

Easy to enhance with more rules or GUI

ðŸŸ© 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic but important concept in cybersecurity â€” password validation. It helps users develop secure habits by creating stronger passwords, and can be further expanded for real-world applications like login systems.
